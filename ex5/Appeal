Fixes in whatsappServer:
Added 'else' in ExecuteCommand so that the server will output an error upon
trying to send a message to non-existent user\group.

Fixes in whatsappClient:
Changed the logic for receiving messages from the server. Before we were
printing the message right away and only then checking if exit command was sent.
Now we first check if its an exit command - if yes, we exit; otherwise continue
with execution (printing the message and so on).
